Programming Assignment #3
Due: Thursday, Oct 11, 2018 OR Tuesday, Oct 16, 2018
Points: 50

Use the simlib library to implement the inventory management simulation described in Section 
1.5 of the textbook. I recommend that you modify the author’s implementation of the inventory 
management simulation to use simlib as described below. Further, I recommend you modify 
the author’s implementation in the order below. 
1. The event list must be stored in a simlib list. 
    • Use event_schedule() and expon() or uniform() function to schedule demand and order 
      arrival events.
    • Use the random_integer() function to determine the demand size.
2. The inventory level must be stored in and retrieved from a simlib list.
3.Compute performance metrics for average ordering cost, average holding cost, and 
  average shortage cost using two methods: the author’s implementation and using simlib (ex 
  sampst() and timest()) functions. For each inventory policy, print the performance metrics 
  calculated by both methods (see sample output file on Blackboard). 

See Content/Assignments/Program #3 on Blackboard for a sample input file (inv.in) and 
matching output file (inv.out).

Write a report (1-2 pages) that explains any differences in results between the author’s 
implementation and the simlib implementation for the three performance metrics. 

You must implement your assignment with C or C++.
